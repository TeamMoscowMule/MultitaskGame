### Project description:

We created a game, which consists of four subgames. Each subgame is played simultaneously. In the first one the player balances a ball on a lath. In the second one the player climbs up and down a ladder to avoid some arrows. In the third one the player jumps to avoid the comming obstacles. In the fourth one the player collects some boxes and he has 10 seconds for each box.
The whole game ends if the player does not succeed in some of the subgames.
The idea is borrowed from [Multitask](http://www.kongregate.com/games/icylime/multitask "Multitask").

### Information:
Three of the subgames are using [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com/ "KineticJS") (Canvas framework) and the fourth one is using vanilla SVG.
The [Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)](https://github.com/jriecken/sat-js) was used for the collision detection between the game objects because they have simple shapes.
